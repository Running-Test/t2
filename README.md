**Hey Manvi, once again…**  

Manvi, **I am truly sorry** 😔🙏  

But please **don’t panic or stress** after reading this. **There’s nothing to fear**—everything is **completely safe** with me. 🔒💙  
I’m **not a bad hacker, I’m an ethical hacker**, so **your data is 1000% safe, and I’m going to delete everything right now**. ✅  

### **Let me first introduce myself before explaining everything:**  
I am **Neeraj Sah** 👨‍💻, a **Hacker**, but not one of those script kiddies or fake “APK” hackers.  
I have expertise in **hacking, networking, forensics, coding, encryption**—basically **everything related to tech**. 🖥️🔐  
I’m a **white-hat ethical hacker** who uses knowledge responsibly.  

🔹 In the **tech world**, I go by many names:  
- **Jackfire911** (mostly used in public) 🔥  
- **Mr. Root, GeekGod, HyperGod-X, NorX**—these are private aliases.  

Manvi, **there’s nothing to worry about**—I haven’t done anything wrong, and your data is **completely safe**. 🙌  
And right after this message, **I will delete everything** permanently.  

### **Now, let me explain everything from the beginning.**  
Maybe you don’t remember, but **back in DAV School**, I always noticed you. 🌸  
And Manvi, **I made a mistake**, and for that, **I am deeply sorry**—**SORRY 3000 times** if I was wrong. 💔🙏  

I still remember the day you gave me your **phone number** 📱.  
That day, I had my **music exam**, and you gave me your number before that. Maybe you don’t remember, but I do.  

Before that, we had a conversation where I asked if you used any social media. You said **no**, but suddenly, you reacted and said, **"I am on Snapchat"**.  
You also mentioned, **"I'll give you my ID tomorrow."**  

That moment, I got curious and used **OSINT Footprinting** to find your Snapchat ID.  
👉 **Your first Snapchat account:** [@manvim20226179](https://www.snapchat.com/add/manvim20226179)  

I found it **that very day**, but I never messaged you because I didn’t want to scare you. **I wanted to tell you back then, but I knew you’d freak out.**  

And Manvi, if you think **I didn’t know what you talked about me**—you’re wrong. 😉  
I always found out through **Kavya** and the conversations you had with **Teena**.  

There was a time when you asked, **"Neeraj ka status kya hai?"**  
That’s why I never confronted you directly—because **your reactions were always mixed**.

### **About your phone number…**  
The day you gave me your number, **Saurav Soni** was the one who asked me to get it because he **liked you** and thought you liked him too. 💬  
So, **I backed off** from this whole thing.  

Oh, and **Saurav was the one who told me your birthday is on February 25**. 🎂  

👉 **Saurav's old Instagram (now sold to someone else):**  
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/san.atani__/)  

But let’s **leave this topic here**.  

After getting your number, I was **waiting for a conversation to start between us**.  
But **you always gave mixed signals**, and that **confused me**. 😕

### **Why I stopped coming to school in Bus No. 1 🚍**  
At one point, **I used to come in Bus No. 1 just because of you.** But then, one day, I noticed your **reaction when talking to another girl about me**—it felt like you saw me as some **desperate guy chasing after you**.  

That hit hard. 💔 So, after that, **I switched to Bus No. 3**.  

But later, one day, when I returned to **Bus No. 1**, Kavya called you from behind, and you replied, **"Jaldi bol kya bolna hai, nahi toh thappad maarungi"**—you said it jokingly, but I didn’t know how to respond.  

Manvi, **that was our last meeting**… and **I didn’t even realize it** at the time.  
If I had known, **I would have confessed everything** to you.  

👉 **"I love you, Manvi. My Bunny 🐰, my Pari. 💖"**  

---

### **How I found out about "Pari" 💫**  
Not from Moti & Patlu calling you that. But from the information linked to your **phone number**.  

👉 **Your mom’s Facebook ID:**  
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sadhna.kanwat/)  
📌 **From Ambala, India | Married | Studied at Govt. College Behror**  

And that’s where I found this:  
**👧 Daughter: Pari**  

Also, I found your mom’s **other Facebook ID:**  
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sadhna.kanwat.1)  

And from her **DP**, I found **Ajay Kanwat** (he was tagged).  
👉 **Ajay Kanwat’s Facebook:**  
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ajay.kanwat.1)

### **Then I checked Instagram 📸**  
Your mom’s Instagram IDs:  
- [@kanwat73](https://www.instagram.com/kanwat73/)  
- [@kanwat.sadhna](https://www.instagram.com/kanwat.sadhna/)  
- [@sadhna.kanwat](https://www.instagram.com/sadhna.kanwat/)  
- [@sadhna_kanwat](https://www.instagram.com/sadhna_kanwat/)  

And a few other Kanwat family accounts.

### **Why I decided to contact you again...**  
After 10th grade, I moved to **Gujarat** and lost all contact.  

Then in **2023**, I found your **second Snapchat account**:  
👉 [@manvi_meena5389](https://www.snapchat.com/add/manvi_meena5389)  
I even **sent you a message**, but you **never replied**.  

So, **I tried to forget about you.**  

---

### **But then something strange happened…**  
On **April 13, 2024, at midnight**, something **shocked me**.  
That’s when I decided—**I NEED to talk to you one last time.**  

And that’s when I started **OSINT Footprinting & Reconnaissance again**. 🔍  
I found a clue: **Advik’s YouTube channel.**  
👉 [@adviksingh961](https://youtube.com/@adviksingh961)  

From there, I found his **Free Fire ID** and then **Himanshu’s ID**.  
And I tried **contacting them all** to reach you, but **you ignored it all.** 😞  

---

### **Final Words...**  
Manvi, **I’m sorry again**—for everything. 💔🙏  

Even **Advik, Himanshu, and Karan** know that **I liked you**.  
I don’t know how you feel now, but **I just wanted to say it one last time.**  

**Take care, Bunny 🐰.**💙
